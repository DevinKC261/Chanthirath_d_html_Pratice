            <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
            <p>This is the first and maypahs the only sentence I'm making.</p>

            <h2>Heading #2</h2>
            <p>There are up to six levels of headings, the higher numbers make it impossible to read</p>

            <h3>Lists</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Putting (ul) makes a list of items</li>
                <li>Typing in (li) adds content to the list</li>
                <li>I can put literally anything here</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Adding (ol) turns the list into numbers</li>
                <li>It should now go by a order instead of dots</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Emphasis Lines</h2>
           <p><em>Emphasis</em> are made using (em)</p>
           <p><strong>Stronger</strong> words are made by nesting strong into a line of code</p>
           <p><em><strong>You can combine the two together</strong></em></p>
